-The Bridge-
The container clicks open and the seal breaks, letting
gas out. You grab the neutron bomb and run as fast as you can to the bridge where you
must place it in the right spot.

You burst onto the Bridge with the netron destruct bomb under your arm
and surprise 5 Gothons who are trying to take control of the ship. Each
of them has an even uglier clown costume than the last. They haven't
pulled their weapons out yet, as they see the active bomb under your arm
and don't want to set it off.
